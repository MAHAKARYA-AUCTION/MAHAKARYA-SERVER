After her martyrdom by the imperial Romans in Alexandria, her body was reputedly carried by angels to a mountaintop in Sinai, near where Moses had received the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments. Almost four hundred years later, monks supposedly discovered her uncorrupted body. The nearby monastery named after her, where her remains were preserved, became a pilgrimage destination in the region second only to the holy places of Palestine.",
